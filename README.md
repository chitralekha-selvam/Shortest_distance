# Shortest_distance
Finds the shortest distance between two places.
It uses Dijstra's algorithm to find the shortest distance between two points.
Copy and run the code.
Enter the no of vertices,adjacency matrix and starting point.
The distance from one vertices to another with their respective path will also be displayed.
From that we can get the shortest path.
